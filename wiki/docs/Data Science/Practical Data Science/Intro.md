Data science is the application of **computational** and **statistical** techniques to address or gain insight into some problem in the **real world**.

Machine learning involves computation and statistics, but has traditionally been not very concerned about answering *scientific questions*. Data science is not machine learning competitions. 

Data science is the iterative cycle of *designing* a concrete problem, building an algorithm to solve it (or determining that this is not possible), and evaluating what insights this provides for the real underlying question.
